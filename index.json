Relationships within Pelagiaria have proven elusive due to short internodes subtending major lineages suggestive of rapid early divergences. Using a novel sequence dataset of over 1000 ultraconserved DNA elements (UCEs) for 94 of the 286 species of Pelagiaria (more than 70% of genera), we provide a time-calibrated phylogeny for this widely distributed clade. Some inferred relationships have clear precedents (e.g. the monophyly of ‘core’ Stromateoidei, and a clade comprising ‘Gempylidae’ and Trichiuridae), but others are unexpected despite strong support (e.g. Chiasmodontidae + *Tetragonurus*). Relaxed molecular clock analysis using node-based fossil calibrations estimates a latest Cretaceous origin for Pelagiaria, with crown-group families restricted to the Cenozoic. Estimated mean speciation rates decline from the origin of the group in the latest Cretaceous, although credible intervals for root and tip rates are broad and overlap in most cases, and there is higher-than-expected partitioning of body shape diversity (measured as fineness ratio) between clades concentrated during the Palaeocene–Eocene. By contrast, more direct measures of ecology show either no substantial deviation from a null model of diversification (diet) or patterns consistent with evolutionary constraint or high rates of recent change (depth habitat). Collectively, these results indicate a mosaic model of diversification. Pelagiarians show high morphological disparity and modest species richness compared to better-studied fish radiations in contrasting environments. However, this pattern is also apparent in other clades in open-ocean or deep-sea habitats, and suggests that comparative study of such groups might provide a more inclusive model of the evolution of diversity in fishes.\n","tags":["Vertebrate phylogenetics","Macroevolutionary patterns","Phylogenetic comparative methods","Divergence dating","UCEs"],"title":"A phylogenomic framework for pelagiarian fishes (Acanthomorpha: Percomorpha) highlights mosaic radiation in the open ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Černý","Daniel Madzia","Graham J.

To investigate the congruence of the estimates of macroevolutionary rates produced by these approaches, we inferred tip-dated phylogenies of bird-hipped dinosaurs (Archosauria: Ornithischia) using the Sampled-Ancestor Fossilized Birth-Death (SA-FBD) process and two of the largest character matrices published to date (73 taxa and 255 characters; 69 taxa and 380 characters). Phylogeny-based diversification rate analyses were performed using the recently released \"fossil BAMM\" (BAMM v2.6) package and a SA-FBD epoch model in BEAST 2. Importantly, no rate shifts were identified in the BAMM analyses, with the posterior probability of the zero-shift configuration ranging from 0.49 to 0.68, and ornithischian evolution was characterized by a single tree-wide density-dependent mode of diversification. Given the high congruence between the prior and posterior rate shift number distributions, we speculate that these findings may be driven by the insufficient number of included tips. A comparison with PyRate, a related Bayesian approach that does not rely on time-calibrated phylogenies, is also presented. We urge caution when applying BAMM-type macroevolutionary analyses to wholly extinct clades, as even the most comprehensive datasets available for extensively studied groups may not be large enough to detect diversification rate shifts.\n","tags":[],"title":"Inferring macroevolutionary dynamics of extinct clades: a test using ‘bird-hipped’ dinosaurs (Ornithischia)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Since 1993, several studies have attempted to apply this framework to interspecific dominance relationships between nonhuman animals. However, this prior work addressed only the corollaries of Lanchester’s laws rather than the laws themselves. Here, we directly test Lanchester’s linear and square law to explain interspecific competition of coral reef fish. First, we analyzed the relationship between body size and dominance to find a biologically accurate proxy of individual fighting ability. We then tested whether group fighting ability was linearly (linear law) or quadratically (square law) related to group size while accounting for the different fighting abilities of competing species. We found support for the linear law; however, both laws were outperformed by a simpler model that only included body size. After accounting for possible outliers and data limitations, we suggest that Lanchester’s linear law may prove useful for explaining interspecific competition in marine ecosystems.\n","tags":["Behavioral ecology","Phylogenetic comparative methods"],"title":"Applying Lanchester’s laws to the interspecific competition of coral reef fish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcela G.M.

Morphology-based taxonomies have recognized anywhere from one to twelve different species. The current IUCN (2017) classification lists eight robust capuchins: *S. xanthosternos*, *S. nigritus*, *S. robustus*, *S. flavius*, *S. libidinosus*, *S. cay*, *S. apella* and *S. macrocephalus*. Here, we assembled the first phylogenomic data set for *Sapajus* using ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) to reconstruct a capuchin phylogeny. All phylogenomic analyses strongly supported a deep divergence of *Sapajus* and *Cebus* clades within the capuchin monkeys, and provided support for *Sapajus nigritus*, *S. robustus* and *S. xanthosternos* as distinct species. However, the UCE phylogeny lumped the putative species *S. cay*, *S. libidinosus*, *S. apella*, *S. macrocephalus*, and *S. flavius* together as a single widespread lineage. A SNP phylogeny constructed from the UCE data was better resolved and recovered *S. flavius* and *S. libidinosus* as sister species; however, *S. apella*, *S. macrocephalus*, and *S. cay* individuals were recovered in two geographic clades, from northeastern and southwestern Amazon, rather than clustering by currently defined morphospecies. STRUCTURE analysis of population clustering revealed widespread admixture among *Sapajus* populations within the Amazon and even into the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest. Difficulty in assigning species by morphology may be a result of widespread population admixture facilitated through frequent movement across major rivers and even ecosystems by robust capuchin monkeys.\n","tags":["Vertebrate phylogenetics","Divergence dating","UCEs"],"title":"A phylogenomic perspective on the robust capuchin monkey (Sapajus) radiation: First evidence for extensive population admixture across South America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael E.

Spiny-rayed fishes (Acanthomorpha) provide an ideal system for exploring the effects of the K–Pg on fish diversification, yet despite decades of morphological and molecular phylogenetic efforts, resolution of both early diverging lineages and enormously diverse subclades remains problematic. Recent multilocus studies have provided the first resolved phylogenetic backbone for acanthomorphs and suggested novel relationships among major lineages. However, these new relationships and associated timescales have not been interrogated using phylogenomic approaches. Here, we use targeted enrichment of 1,000 ultraconserved elements in conjunction with a divergence time analysis to resolve relationships among 120 major acanthomorph lineages and provide a new timescale for acanthomorph radiation. Our results include a well-supported topology that strongly resolves relationships along the acanthomorph backbone and the recovery of several new relationships within six major percomorph subclades. Divergence time analyses also reveal that crown ages for five of these subclades, and for the bulk of the species diversity in the sixth, coincide with the K–Pg boundary, with divergences between anatomically and ecologically distinctive suprafamilial clades concentrated in the first 10 million years of the Cenozoic.
